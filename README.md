## Features

- Analyzes text input and classifies the sentiment as **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral**.
- Utilizes **pre-trained models** for efficient text analysis.
- Supports customizable text input for real-time sentiment evaluation.
- Generates sentiment predictions with **high accuracy**.

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **NLTK** (Natural Language Toolkit)
- **Scikit-learn** (Machine Learning Library)
- **Pandas** (Data manipulation and analysis)
- **Flask** (For creating a web interface - optional, if applicable)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/surajlokesh/Sentiment-Analysis-From-Text-Input.git
   cd Sentiment-Analysis-From-Text-Input
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

   3.	Install dependencies:
   ```

pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

    1.	Run the sentiment analysis script:

python sentiment_analysis.py

    2.	Input a sentence when prompted, and the model will output whether the sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral.
    3.	Optional (Web Interface): If youâ€™re using Flask to create a web interface, run the following command to start the web server:

flask run

    4.	Open a browser and go to http://localhost:5000 to access the sentiment analysis web app (if applicable).
